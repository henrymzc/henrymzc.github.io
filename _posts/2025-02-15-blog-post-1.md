If I were
----
Some days, I find myself drifting into random “What if I were…” questions. What if I were a professor—how would I advise my students? What if I were the mayor of Guangzhou—how would I boost its prosperity? What if I were a historian—what period of history would fascinate me most? These thoughts often appear out of nowhere, but more often than not, they are linked to the careers I casually imagined for myself when I was younger. One of the most frequent “What if I were” questions that comes to mind is: What if I were a middle or high school teacher? And when I think about it, my focus is always on this: What would be the most important thing to teach my students?

Why a middle or high school teacher? First, my teenage years left a deep impression on me—they shaped much of who I am today. Many of my most vivid memories, both in waking life and in dreams, come from that time. I often wonder: Which parts of my middle and high school experience influenced me the most? Second, in Chinese, both middle and high school are called “中学” (literally, “middle school”). It’s an in-between stage—students are no longer as childish and innocent as in primary school, yet not as mature and independent as in college. It’s also a time when they begin to develop their own views of the world. When teachers introduce philosophical ideas or values, students may not fully grasp them, but the seeds are planted. And I believe these early seeds of thought shape the course of a person’s life in ways that aren’t always obvious at the time. So, if I were a teacher, I would think deeply about what ideas are worth planting.

My answer

Of course, this is an open question with no single answer. It depends. In different societies and cultures, certain values may be prioritized over others. It also varies by a student’s age, intellectual ability, and personal traits. But forgive my laziness—I’m not trying to dive deep into this question as if I were writing a research paper. This is just a blog, a place for me to jot down my thoughts as they stand now. And honestly, my views may change as I learn more about education and the world.

That said, if I were a teacher, the number one thing I’d want to pass on to my students is good study and work habits and self-discipline. In economic terms, I view these as abilities that lower the cost of effort. Among some great young people I’ve met, one thing stands out: they are incredibly diligent and self-discipline, but they don’t seem exhausted or being "tortured". To them, working through a tough problem or staying focused for 2 hours isn’t a struggle—it’s just natural. Of course, some of this is shaped by innate traits (like ADHD or other cognitive differences), but I believe it’s also something that can be cultivated.

With good study habits and self-discipline, I believe most middle school students—regardless of their background—can achieve decent academic performance and get into a solid university. And even if they don’t, these habits will still help them secure a stable livelihood, so they won’t have to constantly worry about poverty or hunger. In other words, they’ll have what I call "the freedom in supermarkets". Before pursuing big dreams—freedom, happiness, making a difference in the world—one first needs to secure the basics. Otherwise, those ideals remain like illusions.

The second thing I’d want to pass on to my students is love for themselves, together with the third: love for others and the world. I believe these two kinds of love are key to reducing anxiety and finding happiness in the modern world. I want my students to feel loved—at least by one teacher—so they have the courage to face challenges. I want them to know that my care for them doesn’t depend on their success or failure. And I hope they carry this love forward—to their friends, their families, and even to the world.

If someone focuses only on themselves, they might achieve great career success, but they’ll likely be trapped in endless anxiety about their next challenge, their next achievement, and constant uncertainty in one's life. On the other hand, those who also care a lot about others often find a deeper sense of peace. They worry less about the gain and loss of themselves and enjoy more about the connection with their friends and families.
