My Experience
----
"Last week, I stumbled upon an incredible AI coding setup: VS Code, Cline, and DeepSeek (a combination I learned about from this fantastic [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4uWpeJqMT0). While I was excited about the potential of AI in coding, I was completely blown away by how quickly it's become so accessible to people without much knowledge on python. Using this setup made me feel like a "product manager" guiding the development and a "full-stack software engineer" executing it all.

It felt like I just had to provide the AI with clear prompts, and it took care of everything else. This included downloading necessary packages, creating the virtual environment, writing the code itself, and even debugging errors. To my surprise, it even tested the output and refined the code â€“ all autonomously. Honestly, I didn't even read through all the code; it felt like creating a "useful black box." For someone like me, who isn't super familiar with coding environments, this level of automation is a "game changer". And the best part? This experience only cost me less than $0.2 for a whole afternoon of experimenting! "


Users would benefit from their boldness and creativity
------

AI as foundation component, just like excel
-----

But there is still some differences
-----
mapping

AI-based task is extremely risky
-----

We need "AI examiner" -- perhaps AI can examine AI?
