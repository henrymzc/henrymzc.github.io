Research Idea A: Determinants of International Student Success in the United States
---------
Research Question:
Given that immigration opportunity represents a significant potential return on graduate education investment, what factors determine international students' success in entering the labor market of a developed country and economic prosperity in the United States?
Research Objectives:

The study aims to analyze both extensive and intensive margins of success for international graduate students in the United States. On the extensive margin, we examine factors predicting permanent stay in the United States post-graduation. On the intensive margin, we investigate determinants of economic and professional success among those who remain.

Key Dependent Variables of Interest:
For Extensive Margin :
	Stay/Leave Outcome

For Intensive Margin (Success Metrics):
	Income trajectory post-graduation
	Occupational advancement
	Immigration status progression

Key Independent Variables of Interest:
	Academic background (undergraduate institution location, GPA)
	Graduate program characteristics (field of study, institution ranking)
	Program cost and financial aid structure
	Labor market conditions at graduation
 	Ability (Measured by admission results)

Methodology Considerations:
The research would benefit from a longitudinal dataset tracking international graduate students from admission through several years post-graduation. This could be complemented by LinkedIn Data to create a comprehensive picture of career trajectories.


Research Proposal B: Predictive Validity of Standardized Tests in Graduate Education
------------
Research Question:
What is the predictive power of standardized tests (particularly the GRE) for various outcomes in graduate education, especially for international students?
Research Objectives:
To evaluate the effectiveness of standardized testing in predicting:

Methodological Framework:

The study would analyze the relationship between GRE scores and:
For Master's Programs:
Visa status transitions
Employment outcomes
Geographic mobility

For Doctoral Programs:
Publication output and quality
Citation Impact
Research collaboration networks
Patent applications
Startup formation

Data Requirements:
This research would require combining data from:
Academic publication databases
Patent offices
Immigration records
LinkedIn Data
