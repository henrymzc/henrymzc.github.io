I want to spend $400(3,000 RMB) this year on donation to primary school kids in one of the most under-developed rural areas in China. What is the best way to spend them?

How does this idea start?
======
As stepping into year 2025, I am more eager than before to really do something good on people. The story I learned from an elective course in my college, "Civil Society and Non-Governmental Organization", has been echoed in my mind. This story is about how Western people would take out some proportion of their income every year on donation, no matter for working-class, middle-class or upper-class families. As life becomes more static and stable, I feel that it might be the right time to start this practice.

Donation is not easy

Aren't headings cool?
